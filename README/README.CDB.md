<h2 align="center">How to create a Discord bot</h2>

- Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application.-
-  Inside of the application page under "settings" click Bot & build the bot.
-  After creating the bot you can change the bots username and avatar if you wish.

Bot token is located on the Bot page under username, Do NOT share the token because people can control the bot if they get it.

<h2 align="center">How to run the bot</h2>

Open the bot once to let it automatically generate config.json file.
Remember to always wrap configs with quotation marks, even if it's not necessary for strings.

Fill out the bot's config for the bot token, discord server id, and channel IDs, then start the bot.
